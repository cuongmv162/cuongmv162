title: Layout Engine in Mainstream web-browsers
---
<p align="justify">I started my freelance career years ago, it’s quite short. I was freelance writer for 3 years, until I graduated from college. After that, I don’t have much time for writing, even I tried to contact to my old editors, just I wanna to start writing again just few months ago but I couldn’t do that.</p>
<p align="justify">So, I created my first blog in 2011, it point to cuongmv162.blog.com, unfortunately, I don’t blog much. I have to admit I would like to writing if I got pay for it, hmm I’m not kind of greedy man but I need to pay my college fee, so that’s reason and it is a good reason I guess.</p>
<p align="justify">One of my most favorite, and proud of it is an article, wrote about layout engine in these mainstream web-browsers. Originally, the article wrote in Vietnamese and got published on Genk.vn. I thinking about to translate it to English. If you are Vietnamese, the link hosted on Genk is http://bit.ly/1DUrQV6.</p>
<p align="justify">Of course, time changes and many thing changed, for example Internet Explorer which I could prefer to Spartan, it doesn’t use Trident engine anymore. So, if I translate that article to English, I also need update it.
In the meaning time, you can download the document about Gecko engine which currently using by Mozilla Firefox, and here is the link http://bit.ly/1Dx6ElX.</p>
